# Offline Capabilities

## Standalone Operation
The application is designed to run completely offline with:

1. **Local Processing**
   - All data stored locally in SQLite
   - AI processing runs on local machine
   - Audio processing handled locally via PortAudio

2. **Resource Management**
   - AI models need to be downloaded during installation
   - Local file system used for data storage
   - No cloud dependencies

3. **Installation Requirements**
   - One-time download of AI models
   - Local Python environment setup
   - Required libraries bundled with application

## Considerations for Offline Use

### Storage
- Local database location: `[USER_DATA_DIR]/notes.db`
- Audio files stored locally
- AI models stored in application directory

### Resource Usage
- CPU: AI processing runs locally
- Memory: Model loading requires sufficient RAM
- Disk: Storage for database and audio files

### Limitations
- No cloud backup (unless manually implemented)
- No synchronization between devices
- Updates must be manually installed

## Recommendations for Offline Setup

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Download required AI models during installation
   - Set up proper file permissions
   - Configure local storage paths

2. **Data Management**
   - Implement local backup system
   - Regular cleanup of temporary files
   - Storage space monitoring

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy loading of AI models
   - Efficient resource cleanup
   - Local caching strategies
